          an IIT. Entering into IIT Dharwad would be a huge accomplishment to your academic career as it will change
          your perspective of academics. Here at IITDh, you could choose to explore courses from various streams and

        <div class="gen-block" id="curriculam">
          <h2>
            Curriculum
          </h2>
          The undergraduate curriculum at IIT Dharwad is modelled after the curricula of IIT Bombay which is truly one
          of the most exciting and versatile in India.
          <p>
            <br>
            The academic year is divided into two semesters, namely Autumn and Spring. There are eight semesters in
            total. A certain number of credits/courses needs to be completed each semester. Based on your performance in
            exams, you will be assigned
            a grade at the end of each course which will be relative( IITDh follows relative grading) based on which SPI
            for each semester and CPI for the entire year will be calculated. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Exceptional performance in a course can even earn you the highly valued AP grade in that course which is
            often very rare. Attendance policy at IITDh is very strict. If a student does not meet this specific
            requirement of the attendance
            (80%) , the professor awards them an ‘DX’ grade, which means one will have to repeat the course. So be
            regular in attending the classes:)! FR grade is awarded when a student is unable to achieve the minimum
            cut-off marks in a particular
            course. Finally if you have backlogs, you need to repeat the courses.
          </p>

          At the end of each semester, the weighted average of grades with credits of that particular course yields the
          SPI (Semester Performance Index) for that particular semester. The weighted average of SPI with the total
          credits of the semester
          yields the CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) for all the completed semesters.

          favour and is
          student-friendly. Faculty advisors take constant feedback about the courses and strive to improve the course
