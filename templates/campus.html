				<h2>
					Inside Campus
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Transist Campus
				</h3>
				Our temporary campus accommodates a fully functional academic building, hostels, a gymkhana,
				workshops, fields and much more. The academic building is 3 stories high. There is a well stocked
				library with all the necessary books. There are well
				equipped labs for various disciplines which include two Computer labs, a Physics Lab, a Chemistry
				Lab, a Fluid Dynamics Lab, a Mechanical Workshop, a Strength of Materials Lab, a Heat Transfer Lab,
				a Measurements Lab, Electronics Lab,
				Electronics Power Lab, etc. As more courses are being introduced, labs are being established. There
				is a small canteen in the academic building. It is officially supposed to be open till 10:00 pm, but it
				usually closes much earlier. There is also
				a night canteen in the Bhoopali building which will be open till 2:00 am.

				<h3>
					Permanent Campus
				</h3>
				The Karnataka Government has provided about 470 acres of land for the establishment of the permanent 
				campus of IIT Dharwad, which is about 2-3 km away from the transit campus within the WALMI campus. 
				IIT Dharwad has been working at an accelerated pace on campus development and establishment of 
				infrastructure at the permanent campus site.

				<h2>
					Nearby Places
				</h2>
				IIT Dharwad's location, being on a National Highway means that there are multiple places nearby to
				eat and hang out. While there is ample to do, we'll be only covering food and let you explore the
				rest.


				<h3>Local</h3>
				First of all, there is a Cafe Coffee Day opposite our campus. Near the Cafe Coffee Day is Hyderabadi
				Biryani Restaurant. The biryani here is excellent and reasonably priced. Another nearby place is
				Roti Ghar. It is a pure-veg restaurant. The
				food is good and fairly priced and the place is hygenic. A little away from the campus (around 4km
				towards Dharwad) there is a vegetarian cafe called Seven Beans. It can be reached by cycle or by
				taking a tum-tum. It is a board game cafe
				where you can play Jenga, Snakes and Ladders, Ludo etc while eating. It also has a pool table.
				Around a kilometer away, there is Malabar, which is a non-veg restaurant. Also around 8-9 km from
				the campus is a hotel called Dwarwata. The
				restaurant serves both veg and non-veg food. It is a bit highly priced but the food is good. There
				is also a rooftop place.


				<h3>Dharwad City</h3>
				There is a Dominos in Dharwad. Chilly Chow and Royal kitchen are the other good restaurants in
				Dharwad. CrossRoads Bistro is another small meet up place with delicious ice-creams.


				<h3>Hubli</h3>
				Hubli, AKA Huballi, can be easily reached now via the BRTS (Chigari) bus service. It is a chain of
				air conditioned buses connecting Hubli and Dharwad. It starts from the New Bus Stand in Dharwad. The
				frequency of buses is very high and the
				bus stations are clean and sophisticated. The cost of the ticket is around Rs. 25. Hubli being a
				larger city than Dharwad has a lot more to offer. There is a very scenic lake called lake Unnakal
				which has a garden on its banks (not highly
				recommended though). There is a mall called Urban Oasis which has a multiplex within it. Near this
				mall there is also Barbeque Nation. There is a decently sized decathlon in Hubli with a small
				concrete turf/basketball court which can be
				booked. There is also a much larger choice of places to eat in Hubli in general.

				<h2>
					Hostels
				</h2>
				A lot of you would surely be leaving your house for the first time while others may know a little
				about hostel culture. In any case a good hostel culture and atmosphere is only going to boost your
				morale at all times, be it during exams or a
				festival celebration. At IIT Dharwad the hostels provided are among the best ones among all the IITs
				(maybe because they’re quite new). The first year hostel is located right beside the academic
				building (so you can just wake up and run to
				your class). All other hostels are located 1.4 km behind at the far end of the campus along with the
				sports grounds and the famous Bhoopali building which houses the gymkhana, mess, a night
				canteen, etc. The first year hostel is a co-ed hostel
				with the ground floor housing the Girls’ Wing, the Keeravani Mess and the lobby and TV area. Boys
				are allocated rooms on the first and second floors. There is 24/7 security in front of all the
				hostels.


				<h3>Hostel Allocation</h3>
				Hostel rooms will be allocated to the first year students’ prior to their registration. The keys of
				the respective rooms would be provided to the students right after their registration on the
				reporting day. The first year students’ hostel
				(also known as Keeravani Hostel, yes it is named after a raga in classical music) has 3 floors with
				every room accommodating 4 students (yes, there’ll be bunk beds which are fun :P).

				<h3>Basic Amenities</h3>
				Each room has a pair of bunk beds (4 beds), tables, chairs, cupboards, ceiling fans, tubelights and
				are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. Rooms have attached washrooms with 24x7
				running water. There are geysers in the
				washrooms and there is availability of hot water according to a time table (which you will find on
				the hostel notice board). Washing machines (4 to be precise) are also available on the ground floor,
				timings for which again will be available
				on the notice board. The Keeravani Hostel has its own mess (dining hall), water coolers, TV room and
				indoor games like Table Tennis, Chess and Carrom.

				
				<h3>Girls' Hostel</h3>
				Girls' hostel offers a comprehensive range of well-maintained and essential facilities, including two washing machines in each wing, a designated drying area, readily available drinking water cans, and hot water in showers. Ensuring safety, a dedicated security lady is stationed at the front door, while our diligent cleaning staff keeps the rooms, showers, and washrooms clean on a daily basis. We take pride in providing a comfortable and secure living environment where residents can focus on personal growth and well-being.


				<h3>Hostel Activities</h3>
				There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostels which makes life fun. A variety of
				festivals like Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Teacher’s Day, Women’s Day
				etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along
				with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels
				vibrant and lively the entire year around. Do participate in whatever intrigues you, of course after
				having devoted enough time to academics. It
				helps you in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors as well.


				<h3>Hostel Council</h3>
				All the hostel affairs would be dealt under the supervision of the General Secretary Hostel Affairs
				(GSHA, whom you will get to know in your orientation programme). There is a Hostel Secretary for
				each hostel along with room representatives
				to make sure all the odd jobs of the hostels are taken care of. Each hostel has its own warden who
				will be your point of contact for all the issues you are facing in the hostel, which will be
				announced during the orientation programme. All
				important contact numbers are displayed on the notice board of the hostels. There will also be a
				separate mess committee (comprising the first year students) for the Keeravani Mess. There will be a
				separate Sports Secretary & Cultural
				Secretary to look after respective matters among the first year students. As far as the apex council
				is concerned, we have General Secretaries for Sports Affairs, Mess Affairs, Cultural Affairs,
				Academic Affairs and Hostel Affairs who look
				after respective matters for the whole institution.

				<br>
				<br>
				PS: All hostel buildings and the famous Bhoopali building at IIT Dharwad are named after ragas of
				classical music (along with a number starting from 0 for the Keeravani Hostel) showing the cultural
				background of Dharwad as a birthplace of
				legendary musicians.

				<h2>
					Internet and Cellular
				</h2>
				Life without the internet is possible, right? Well think again. From receiving mails/study material
				to uploading your Instagram stories, the internet is one thing you need to sort out ASAP to avoid
				getting a FOMO. The entire campus of IIT
				Dharwad is WiFi enabled. Just turn on your WiFi and connect to IITDh-Wireless or eduroam with your
				LDAP ID (roll number) and password (you will be provided with all relevant instructions).

				We have a 100 Mbps bandwidth from National Knowledge Network (NKN) and additional 100 Mbps bandwidth
				from BSNL. This enables blazing fast internet connectivity for every device.

				There are two computer labs in the academic building where you can access the WiFi as well as the
				LAN. Just go to https://internet.iitdh.ac , login your LDAP ID and password, and you’re good to go.
				The ground floor computer lab is available
				24x7.
