          Sports
        </h2>
        Excellence in sports is a direct index of the stature and intellectual maturity of an institute. All the
        facilities are helmed by seasoned training staff so that even beginners have a beautiful chance to learn the
        craft and their more experienced counterparts can receive the requisite guidance. IIT Dharwad offers its
        students the following sports facilities:

        <p></p>
        <br>
        <table class="table">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>BOARD GAMES</td>
              <td>FOOTBALL</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>VOLLEYBALL</td>
              <td>ATHLETICS</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>BASKETBALL</td>
              <td>CRICKET</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>HOCKEY</td>
              <td>LAWN TENNIS</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>TABLE TENNIS</td>
              <td>WEIGHTLIFTING</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SWIMMING*</td>
              <td>BADMINTON*</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        Besides, every hostel has dedicated table tennis and board games and is completely decked with various
        equipment which can be issued by students.
        <p></p>
        <h3>Sports for everyone</h3>
        To ensure a healthy continuity of this tradition the Sports Council organises a multitude of sports and
        fitness camps that vary in the degree of professionalism (amateur, intermediate or advanced) as well as the
        rigor of instruction.
        The Government of India, through the National Sports Organisation, mandates that all incoming freshmen must
        undergo a structured training in a sport of their choice. At IIT Dharwad, NSO forms an integral part of the
        curriculum and classes are offered in a student’s sport of choice.

        <p></p>
        <h3>Championships</h3>
        At the institute level itself, a steady string of competitive events is organised throughout the year with
        tournaments on conventional sports, upcoming games as well as their modern improvisations.
        <h3>Inter-IIT Sports Meet</h3>
        <p>IIT Dharwad Sports contingent has been participating in the Inter IIT Sports Meet since 2016, having
          secured its first medal in Para-power lifting in 2018. IIT Dharwad with a strong contingent of 87 players
          participated in the ensuing Inter IIT Sports Meet which was held at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bhubaneswar in the
          month of December 2019. Representing IIT Dharwad at the Inter IIT Sports Meet is the ultimate honor for any
          student at the institute. Each year, one of the seven older IITs host contingents from the other IITs, with
          players in their quest for glory competing fiercely to lift the coveted trophy. Getting to represent IIT
          Dharwad at this event in the first year itself has to be a matter of great honour and pride for any freshman
          (If you are good enough, you are sure to get a chance!).
